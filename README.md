The Employee Data Upload System is a web-based application that streamlines the process of uploading, validating, and managing employee data from Excel files. 
Built with Python (Flask) and utilizing libraries like pandas for data handling, the system ensures robust validation for all fields, including Employee ID, Name, Dates, Contact Details, and Salaries. 
Successfully validated records are stored in the database, while errors are displayed with detailed feedback for corrections. 
This project offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing large volumes of employee data with accuracy andÂ reliability.
